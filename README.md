# TicTacToe

One of my assignments from my CS 3280 class that I took in Spring of 2025. The class required us to make a Tic Tac Toe game written in C# as a WPF application. The program contains a two-player mode and a mode where a computer player makes moves. (the computer player was extra credit. I spent quite a while testing how a player moving after the human should make a move.)
