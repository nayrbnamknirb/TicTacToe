# TicTacToe

One of my assignments from my CS 3280 class that required you to make a Tic Tac Toe game written in C# as a WPF application. It contains a two-player mode and a mode where a computer player makes moves. (the computer player was extra credit. I spent quite a while testing how a player moving after the human should make a move.)
